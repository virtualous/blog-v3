title: Why did I start WebJeda?
desc: >-
  While I was working in Cognizant Technology Solutions I always used to have a
  tab open on my internet browser - github.com. I had learning period of two
  months in which I googled a lot about it and learned a lot about Github Pages.
  I wanted to make it easier for the newbies.

{: .intro}

While I was working on network security, I was also learning HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. I used to implement the code I wrote into **Github Pages** to see how it comes out. It was not always a positive result. I had to debug a lot and fix the code rather copy pasting it. That was the beginning of my journey towards Github :octocat:.

Initially, I had to design a website for my friend. It was supposed to have all the details of her company, contact information and frequent updating of tournament results. It is actually a website for on-line chess coaching business. I created a website using **Adobe Muse** - which is a non-coders best friend. It was all good but I had a problem hosting it. I tried a free service called vlexo. It was good for a free service but it asked us to put a link back to their website on my website. And also, the response time was not so good. I was looking for an alternative since then.

Meanwhile, I used to see many **.io** website links in google search results which are strange for me back then. Once I open such links, I always used to find a minimal, aesthetically pleasing, and content oriented website. 


I was curious to know how they did it. After some research, I found out that they are hosted using Github Pages. So I chose Github Pages (which is free) to host my website. It was all good but when it came to forms, I did not know how to [make a form for static website](/jekyll-subscribe-form/){:target="_blank"}. As a business, we had new parents contacting us through the form on our website asking about the details. Since forms did not work on Github, I moved that site to WordPress. <strike>It is still in WordPress</strike>  - [inapurichessworld](http://inapurichessworld.com)

But by this time I had a good hang of Github Pages and started hosting my websites on it.

I created(or used a theme for) few websites like

[Dxartist](http://dxartist.github.io/){:rel='nofollow'}

[c10h14n2](http://c10h14n2movie.com){:rel='nofollow'}

They are old and discontinued but I it was a good learning curve building these websites. I kept them in the repository as a memory. 


I realized (very late) that web designing is my passion. I kept on learning more about html5. I also started learning Android application development. I never thought I can make it a business but I fully enjoyed making modern websites.


Learning was always there. Even today I have something to learn every other day. I have seen people struggling to figure out how Github works. Maybe because it didn't have easy-to-understand documents. 

I have learned (learning :dog:) Github through many tutorials and documentation. I used Github for my personal projects. I have started making video lessons on Github Pages. I will tell you all about it in the [next post](/coding-and-more/){: target="_blank"}.
