## Why teach Github Pages :octocat: ?
{: .clear}
While I was learning Github Pages, I used to go through YouTube videos. But there was not a single guy who teaches it without using Command Line Interface(CLI). When we run a command on CLI, the output may not be the same for everyone. It depends on the previous installations, dependencies, and a correct PATH variable etc. For starters, CLI is a hard nut to crack. So wanted to make it easier and decided not use CLI in my videos. Everything is done through GUI .


I see a lot of blogs providing useful information on Github pages and Jekyll. But in my blogs, i want to provide step by step instructions for everything without missing a single point. This is what I expect from a blog or a documentation. So that is what I follow.


## What is Github?
Github is Version Control System. It keeps your data and tracks all the changes you make to it. If that is not a sufficient explainayion then condider this example. Let's say there is a **box**. Initially you keep **lego blocks** in it. Then after some time you take the help of your friend and make a house out of those blocks and keep it back in the box and after several days you break the house and build a bridge out of it and keep it in the box.

But at this point you realize that the house was nicer than this bridge. Thanks to **box** that it remembers the exact way how you built the house. So in no time you can get back to the house model. 

Now, the box has several compartments in it. One of those is a **live** compartment. If you make a **Robot** out of your legos blocks and keep it inside the live compartment then the Robot gets to life and starts walking.

The **box** is GitHub, the **live compartment** is Github Pages and legos is your code. When you put a website code (html, css, js) in Gihub Pages, website gets hosted!

Many web developers are not familiar with Github. They struggle to find a reliable hosting service and they may end up paying few bucks which is not necessary when you have Github Pages for the rescue. You can host your website in minutes for free!

Read my tutorial on [how to host a website on github.](https://blog.webjeda.com/how-to-create-and-host-a-website-on-github-pages/){:rel='dofollow'}
and then [sync a complete website using this tutorial](http://blog.webjeda.com/how-to-sync-files-folders-with-github){:rel='dofollow'}.


Making it simple has helped a lot of people to start off with Github. I'm glad I helped. I got a very positive response for my efforts. A few in the screenshot below

Another thing I found very difficult was choosing the right tools for web development. There are some tools I recommend for new web designers 

[**Brackets**](http://brackets.io){:rel='nofollow'} - an awesome code editor. (recommended plugin - [emmet](http://emmet.io/download/){:rel='nofollow'})

[**Prose**](http://prose.io){:rel='nofollow'} - an awesome online code editor.

[**Github Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/){:rel='nofollow'} - to sync files with your repository.

[**Chrome Browser**](https://www.google.com/chrome/){:rel='nofollow'} - for its 'inspect' feature and JavaScript v8 engine.

[**w3schools**](www.w3schools.com/){:rel='nofollow'} - they are the best at teaching how to code.

I hope you are wondering why **Sublime text** is not included in the list. I used to prefer Sublime text over Brackets! But for my blog posts, I needed a plugin to count the words. It was easy installing it on Brackets. Moreover, Brackets has live preview option!  And also, in-line editing makes it better than any other text editor.

Github Pages is comparably faster than conventional web hosting services for static websites. But, Github cannot execute files in the server. So php files will not run in Github. But you are good to use HTML, CSS and JS. 


Jekyll static site generator is another boon to web designers to host their blogs or single page websites. I have created many blogs using Jekyll. Actually, this blog is completely generated using Jekyll! It is very stable. Uptime of the websites depends on Github Servers. As an established company, Github is always up. I have not faced any major issue so far. I think years ago my blogs were down for few seconds.

Finally, what I suggest for new developers is to get familiar with Github and contribute to the community. Only after making hundreds of mistakes, one can learn to code better. Make mistakes, correct it and learn while doing so.

Thank me later
